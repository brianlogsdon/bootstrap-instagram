# Bootstrap Instagram

An instagram photo feed created with bootstrap. 

## What I Learned
* Create a website that looks exactly like [this one](https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=instagram-feed-bootstrap&preview).
* Start the CSS and HTML from scratch, please do not re-use from another exercise because you will end up having a mess.
* Use all the possible [bootstrap utilities (helpers)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities), take your time to read them all because it will make your life 99% easier.
* The projects has to be 100% responsive using the bootstrap grid system.
* Use all the possible bootstrap components, the idea is that you learn them so you can re-use them during the rest of your life.
